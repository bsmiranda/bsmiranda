# Hi, Bruno Miranda here! ðŸ‘‹

I have a strong interest in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Business.
Currently I have been dedicating myself to learning these technologies in order to make my contribution in this field.

I would like to be able to make my contribution acting as a computer scientist in the field of education, providing quality and accessible education through technology.

I also have a strong interest in healthcare, business and financial markets and I believe that technology can help boost these very important sectors of the economy.

At the moment I'm looking for my first opportunity in a company to work with Data Science. ðŸ™‚
